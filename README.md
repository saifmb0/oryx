**ORYX** is an enterprise-grade search intelligence platform optimized for the UAE and Gulf markets. Unlike generic SEO tools, ORYX integrates local geography, bilingual intent (Arabic/English), and the semantic nuances of B2B contracting.

It extends traditional keyword research into **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**—optimizing content for citation by AI models such as Gemini, ChatGPT, and Perplexity.

## System Architecture

The ORYX pipeline is divided into two main stages: **Data Processing** (Ingestion & Validation) and **Intelligence Generation** (Scoring & Reporting).

### Stage 1: Data Processing Pipeline

This stage focuses on acquiring raw data and stripping away navigation noise and "Franken-keywords."

    subgraph Ingestion [1. Data Acquisition]
        A[Seed] --> B(Resilient Scraper)
        B -->|Block Filter| C[Clean HTML]
    end

    %% 2. Validation Phase
    subgraph Validation [2. Linguistic Checks]
        C --> D[Sentence Tokenizer]
        D --> E[POS & Logic Gates]
    end
```
Stage 2: Intelligence & Scoring Engine
Once data is validated, it enters the scoring engine where it is ranked for naturalness, intent, and commercial value.

        G --> H[Hallucination Audit]
    end

    %% 4. Reporting Phase
    subgraph Reporting [4. Output]
        H --> I[Clustering]
        I --> J[Opportunity Score]
        J --> K[Excel / JSON]
    end
```
Key Features
1. Deep Localization
ORYX utilizes a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) system populated with over 200 UAE-specific entities.

Districts: Mussafah, ICAD, KIZAD, Mohammed Bin Zayed City.

Regulatory Bodies: TAMM, Estidama, DED, Tawtheeq.

Legal Frameworks: Musataha, Freehold, Leasehold.

2. High-Precision Anti-Hallucination
To ensure data integrity, the system employs a multi-layer verification process (v3.2.0):

Sentence Boundary Detection: Uses NLTK to prevent navigation menus and footers from merging into incoherent phrases.

Semantic Logic Gates: Enforces business logic (e.g., preventing "buy" intent for service-based entities like contractors).

Perplexity Scoring: Uses sentence-transformers to reject unnatural or machine-generated phrasing by measuring semantic distance from natural query patterns.

3. Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)
The system analyzes content for "Information Gain" and "Trust Signals" (E-E-A-T), prioritizing keywords and topics likely to be cited by Large Language Models.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or higher

Virtual Environment (recommended)

Setup
```Bash

git clone [https://github.com/saifmb0/oryx-engine.git](https://github.com/saifmb0/oryx-engine.git)
cd oryx-engine
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[all]"
Usage
Basic Execution
Run the pipeline with the default configuration.
```
```Bash

oryx run --seed-topic "turnkey villa construction" --geo ae
Market-Specific Presets
```

Load specialized configurations for specific verticals. The following example targets the Abu Dhabi contracting sector:
```Bash

oryx run \
  --seed-topic "commercial fit out" \
  --preset presets/contracting_ae.yaml \
  --geo ae \
  --output "strategy_report.xlsx"
```
Configuration
ORYX is highly configurable via config.yaml or preset files. Key configuration sections include:

Scrape: Controls timeout, retries, and proxy rotation settings.

NLP: Defines n-gram ranges and document frequency thresholds.

Cluster: Adjusts the sensitivity of the semantic clustering algorithm.

GEO: Sets target region, primary emirate, and bilingual processing modes.
